    "# Use OpenAI Dall-E to generate an image dataset for image classification\n",
    "This notebook explores how we can use generative AI to create datasets which don't exist yet. This can be a good starting point for your project if you have not collected or cannot collect the data required. It is important to note the limitations of generative AI still apply here, biases can be introduced through your prompts, results can include \"hallucinations\" and quality control is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses the openai API to call the Dall-E image generation tool, it explores both generation and variation but there are other tools such as editing which could also be useful for augmenting an existing dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have wrapped this example into a [Transformation Block](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-studio/organizations/research-data/creating-a-transformation-block-dataset) (Enterprise Feature) to make it even easier to generate images.
