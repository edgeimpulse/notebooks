    "🤗 [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) offers a suite of tools that assist with various AI applications. Most notably, they provide a [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) for people to share their pre-trained models. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to download a simple [ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network) model from the Hugging Face hub, profile it, and convert it to a C++ library for use in your edge application. This particular model was trained to identify species of bean plants using the [bean dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/beans).\n",
