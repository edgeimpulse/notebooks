    "The Edge Impulse object detection model (FOMO) is effective at classifying objects and very lightweight (can run on MCUs). It does not however have any object persistence between frames. One common use of computer vision is for object counting- in order to achieve this you will need to add in some extra logic when deploying.\n",
